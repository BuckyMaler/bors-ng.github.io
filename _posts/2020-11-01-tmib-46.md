It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a bot for workflows where [accepted pull requests are merged with the main branch in a temporary branch](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/416662).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2020-10-01..2020-10-31),
we landed 11 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
