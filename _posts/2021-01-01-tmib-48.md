### Notable Additions

* notriddle added evaluation results for [neutral](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1094) and [skipped](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1112) results
  * NOTE: the previous behavior was erattic, but appeared to "work" for some people. If you have two GitHub Action jobs with the same name, and were using them as an indicator for bors, [you can rely on the `success()` one to signal a failure when it's canceled](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide/pull/452/commits/ca6e9735eeb9182ba17a4e61fc5d494d3412f6a6).
* little-dude [added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/996) a way to log requests to GitHub
* notriddle [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1093) a [couple](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1097) batcher registry bugs
* dieend [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1116) a long-standing bug that caused "duplicate batcher" crashes on restart
* notriddle [added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/1107) a useful error message on bors.toml with duplicate status lines
