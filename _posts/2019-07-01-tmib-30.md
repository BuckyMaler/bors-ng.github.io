It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [one way to solve Pablo's problem](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/06/python-language-summit-lightning-talks-part-2.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2019-06-04..2019-06-30),
we landed 11 PRs in the bors-ng repository, mostly written by @umamaistempo. Wow, you were on a roll this month!

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide/), Rust language bindings to libsodium.

[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) is a cryptography library. It's a fork of [NaCL](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), ported to use regular GNU Automake and Visual Studio projects instead of NaCL's odd `do` build system, providing package definitions for popular operating systems and build systems, and more functionality.

libsodium and nacl are both designed to be used by non-cryptography experts, providing a simple, easy-to-use C API with good security  and good documentation. Despite their raison d'Ãªtre being usability, and the resulting security benefits of being more usable, their cryptographic primitives are often faster than other cryptographic libraries.

Got any suggestions for next month?
